# Daily trend filter (D1) and the trend-hold@240m paper sleeve

PAPER ONLY. Nothing here changes a safety lock (`PAPER_TRADING`, `DRY_RUN`,
`ALLOW_LIVE_TRADING`). Both features refuse to run unless all locks are engaged.

Source of every number below: `scripts/study_d1_trendhold.py` (pre-registered,
decision rule fixed before the run). Output files: `data/d1_trendhold_report.txt` and
`data/d1_trendhold_results.json`. Reproduce it with:

```bash
python scripts/study_d1_trendhold.py --data-dir <pipeline data> --daily-dir <dir with *_1440.csv>
```

Data: the 121-day tick pipeline (Jun 4 → Oct 2 2026) for BTC/ETH/SOL, plus Kraken
public daily OHLC. The daily closes match the tick-built UTC daily closes to 0.0 bps
over 119 days.

Costs:
- Base: taker 40 bps plus 5 bps slippage per side, maker 25 bps.
- Stress: 80 + 10.

## 1. Daily risk-on filter (D1)

`src/dublin_bot/daily_filter.py`

- **risk-on** means the last *closed* UTC daily close is above SMA50 of daily closes, and
  SMA50 is above its value 5 days earlier.
- **No look-ahead.** An intraday bar only sees a daily bar whose close is at or before
  that intraday bar's close. Today's forming daily bar is never used.
- **Fails closed.** While SMA50 is warming up, or if daily data is unavailable, entries
  are blocked. Live, the daily bars come from Kraken *public* OHLC, cached per UTC day.
  A stale value from the same day is reused if a refresh fails. No private endpoint is
  ever called.
- **Gates entries only.** It never forces an exit and never blocks one. Held positions
  keep their normal exits (ATR trail, regime exit, TP/stop, and so on).
- **Config** (all default `true`):

  | Setting | Applies to |
  |---|---|
  | `REGIME_DAILY_FILTER` | regime_trend@60m |
  | `MEANREV_DAILY_FILTER` | meanrev_mk@240m |
  | `TRENDHOLD_DAILY_FILTER` | trend-hold@240m |

- When D1 blocks an entry, the WAIT reason says so: `D1 risk-off (...)` or
  `D1 unknown ... entries blocked`.

### Walk-forward with and without D1 (net bps per trade, base costs)

**Decision rule (pre-registered).** D1 ships default-OFF only if it *clearly hurts*:
the out-of-sample (OOS) view-A sum is lower **and** D1 is worse in at least 3 of the 4
OOS folds.

**regime@60m**

| View | No D1 | D1 |
|---|---|---|
| A: fixed OOS, folds 1–4 | n=40, mean +112, median −117, ex-best-2 −8, stress +25, sum +4501 | n=29, mean +196, median −128, ex-best-2 +32, stress +108, sum +5680 |
| B: walk-forward select | n=38, mean +107 | n=29, mean +164 |
| Audit split, IS (< Aug 3) | n=26, mean −52 | n=2, mean −130 |
| Audit split, OOS (≥ Aug 3) | n=27, mean +232 | n=27, mean +220 |

Fold means (folds 1 / 2 / 3 / 4):

| Variant | Fold 1 | Fold 2 | Fold 3 | Fold 4 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| No D1 | −135 | −89 | +393 | +176 |
| D1 | −130 | −151 | +393 | +176 |

D1 is worse in 1 of 4 folds (fold 2), so it ships **default ON**. Its real effect is to
take the strategy out of the market during the down-trend part of the sample: in the
audit's IS window it cuts trades from 26 to 2. It does almost nothing once the daily
trend is up, as in the audit OOS window.

**meanrev_mk@240m.** OOS is identical with and without D1: 14 trades, 79% win, mean
+100, median +91, ex-best-2 +43, stress +54. In the IS split D1 cuts trades from 12 to
6. Not worse in any fold, so it ships **default ON**.

Caveat: the regime OOS sample is still small (29–40 trades), and the median trade is
negative. Most of the edge comes from a few large trend wins.

## 2. trend-hold@240m (third paper sleeve)

`strategies/trendhold_strategy.py`, `trendhold_sleeve.py`, `backtest_core.trendhold_signals`

- **Entry.** After a 4h bar closes with D1 on, close > EMA100 and EMA20 > EMA100, the
  sleeve does a paper market buy on the next cycle, which is the next bar's open (taker
  fee plus slippage). It never chases a signal more than one bar old.
- **Exit.** At the first 4h close below EMA100, on a bar that closed after the fill,
  it does a paper market sell. No hard stop and no TP, as specified.
- **Size.** 25% of the $500 paper book per coin (`TRENDHOLD_POSITION_FRACTION`, at most
  0.34), times the learner size multiplier. It is capped by the room left under the
  total exposure cap and by free cash.
- **Universe.** BTC/USD, ETH/USD and SOL/USD (`TRENDHOLD_SYMBOLS`).
- **State.** `logs/trendhold_sleeve.json`. The last cycle is written to
  `logs/last_cycle_trendhold.json`. Each cycle writes a `CYCLE sleeve=trendhold_4h ...`
  line to the paper log.

### Cross-sleeve limits (all three sleeves together)

| Limit | Value | How it's enforced |
|---|---|---|
| One position per coin across ALL sleeves | — | `logs/paper_sleeve_owners.json` (`SleeveRegistry`) is extended with the `trendhold_4h` owner. Every sleeve skips a coin another sleeve holds or has pending, and the primary engine already honours the registry. |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_POSITIONS` | **3** (unchanged) | Counts every held lot plus every pending order from every sleeve. |
| `MAX_POSITION_FRACTION` | **0.25** (unchanged) | |
| `MAX_EXPOSURE_FRACTION` | **0.75** in `run_paper_mac.sh` (was 0.50) | This is the **only limit change**. It lets three 25% positions coexist. Exposure counts every lot at market plus pending orders. The code default stays 0.50 for non-paper use. |
| Daily-loss breaker, drawdown breaker, cooldown | — | Shared `RiskManager` + `SessionState`. |

### Out-of-sample result vs buy-and-hold (Aug 3 → Oct 2 2026, $500 book)

| Variant | Return | Max DD (mark-to-market) | Max DD (realized only) | Trades |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 25%/coin + D1 (**as shipped**) | **+16.15%** | −7.36% | −3.58% | 18 |
| 1/3 per coin + D1 (audit's book) | +21.22% | −9.49% | −4.75% | 18 |
| 25%/coin + D1, stress costs | +11.54% | −8.87% | −5.08% | 18 |
| 25%/coin, no D1 | +16.54% | −7.40% | −3.81% | 19 |
| **Buy & hold, equal weight** | **+43.66%** | −7.41% | — | — |

- **Buy & hold by coin:** BTC +32.8%, ETH +41.7%, SOL +60.5%.
- **Per-trade results (25% + D1):** 33% win, mean +367 bps, median −179 bps.
- **Per coin:**

  | Coin | Trades | Mean bps | Median bps |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|
  | BTC | 6 | +215 | −166 |
  | ETH | 6 | +394 | −163 |
  | SOL | 6 | +492 | −212 |

- **IS check (Jul 9 → Aug 3):** −1.31% with D1 (3 trades) and −3.47% without, against
  buy & hold +0.65%.

**Audit claim check.** The audit claimed +20% and −4.7% max drawdown. The return
reproduces within about a point on the audit's 1/3-per-coin book (+21.2%). The −4.7% is
a **realized-only** drawdown: it is computed on closed-trade equity, and our
realized-only figure on the same book is −4.75%. The honest mark-to-market drawdown of
that book is −9.5%, and −7.4% at the shipped 25% size.

**In a strong up-trend, trend-hold lagged buy-and-hold by about 27 points**: +16% vs
+44%, with about the same mark-to-market drawdown. It is a paper experiment in risk
reduction (time out of the market in down-trends), not a proven edge.

## Promotion

Neither feature can promote anything to live. The live-promotion bar (at least 30
closed paper trades per strategy, a positive 90% lower bound, and so on) is a separate
report-only check.
